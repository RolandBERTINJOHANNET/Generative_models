# Generative_models
Python code (.py or .ipynb) I wrote for a selection of generative deep learning models : AE (fully connected), AE (convolutional), VAE, VQ-VAE, GAN, conditional GAN, on varied image datasets.
Some models are written using keras, others in pytorch.
Note : the LFW dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset
